    "mu_description": "Barefoot Gen recounts the bombing of Hiroshima from the perspective of a young boy, Gen, and his family. But the book's themes (the physical and psychological damage ordinary people suffer from war's realities) ring chillingly true today. Gen and his family have long been struggling without much food, money or medicine, but despite hardships, they try to maintain a semblance of normal life. The adults are exhausted and near despair; the children take air raids and starvation more or less in stride. Nakazawa, a Hiroshima survivor, effectively portrays the strain of living in this environment and shows how efforts to stay upbeat in dire circumstances sometimes manifest as manic, irrational humor. The story offers some optimism: characters perform acts of self-sacrifice for the sake of neighbors and loved ones (e.g., when Gen's pregnant mother becomes ill from malnutrition, he and his brother pose as orphans and perform in the streets, throwing the money over the walls of their home so they won't get caught). Underneath this can-do attitude are the parents' deep guilt and sense of helplessness. When the children clamor ecstatically over a scrap of food, the parents dissolve in shame and grief. The art is sharply drawn and expressive, and the narrative has such a natural rhythm, it's easy to get pulled into the family's life, making the cataclysm readers know awaits them all the more real, intimate and difficult to take. Despite its harrowing nature, this work is invaluable for the lessons it offers in history, humanity and compassion.",

While the plots are gag-driven, much of the humor comes from the juxtaposition of mundane characters with the bizarrely incongruous (Nakagawa's wealth, Maria's appeal, everyone's lack of actual police work), most of which is never explained or rationalized in the slightest.\n\nNote: Won the Seiun Award for Best Comic in 2017.",

It takes dedication and discipline to be the best, and the Shohoku High hoops team wants to be just that. They have one last year to make their captain's dream of reaching the finals come true--will they do it? Takehiko Inoue's legendary beloved basketball manga is finally here and the tale of a lifetime is in your hands.  \nHanamichi Sakuragi's got no game with girls—none at all! It doesn't help that he's known for throwing down at a moment's notice and always coming out on top. A hopeless bruiser, he's been rejected by 50 girls in a row! All that changes when he meets the girl of his dreams, Haruko, and she's actually not afraid of him! When she introduces him to the game of basketball, his life is changed forever.\n\nTo commemorate the 100 Million sales of the series, a one-shot called “10 Days After” was drawn by the author in a classroom at Kanagawa Prefectural Misaki High School in December 2004. This epilogue later published in a special documentary book and Switch magazine in 2005.\n\nNotes: Received the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen in 1995.",

    "mu_description": "Japan in the future has a massive over-population problem. Scientists have traced the root of this problem to one particular individual, Junta Monamari. According to their records, Junta was a \"Mega-Playboy\" who had sired children with over a hundred women. Each one of his sons had inherited the Mega-Playboy gene too, so the problem grew exponentially from thereon. Enter Karin Aoi, a \"DNA Operator\". Karin is sent back to the past with a mission: to alter Junta's DNA and prevent him from ever becoming the Mega-Playboy, thereby eliminating the world's overpopulation problem. Junta's DNA can only be altered by shooting him with a special bullet called DCM which contains the chemical for suppressing the Mega-Playboy DNA. In return, Karin gets a vast sum of money... enough to make all her dreams come true. Will Junta become the playboy he is destined to be, or will his better self prevail? But Karin is falling for the real Junta too... and what of the sweet and kindly Ami who has secretly loved Junta all her life? What will happen to future Japan?",

She is very attractive but, she also has the tendency to drain the life force out of people. She surprises the life out of him (literally) when she kisses him unconscious. Lilim then flies off for more \"food,\" but returns later, saying that Takaya's life-energy was the \"tastiest.\" From then, Lilim is accepted by Takaya's parents as a live-in girlfriend of sorts, and Takaya's heart seems to start wavering towards this voluptuous devil.",

She meets a demon that tells her to give up her \"work,\" to keep the harmony between the human and supernatural worlds.\n\nVolume 24 contains 13 (サーティーン)\n\nVolume 38 contains Bankara (ばんから)  \nThe cyber revolution seems to be a new weapon that school delinquents take advantage of and cause damage.

One day, as their group was about to start a reconstruction work of a tunnel which was destroyed by an earthquake, a much more powerful construction team arrived and claimed the land in no time, killing Jumbor who tried to protect his teammates against the cruel opponents...\n\nJumbor woke up in 3007, finding himself revived in his own clone body (memory transplanted) which has a physical age of 5 years old, and in addition to that, his body was partly mechanized. His robot arms are linked up to and directly controlled by his brain's signals. He was told that the country had gone and the princess and the king disappeared, and he discovered that his mechanized body is very powerful. He was also told he was 'last of the series'.\n\nThe series was canceled after ten issues and released in one volume. The two oneshots under the title of \"Jumbor\" and \"Jumbor - The Desert With a Floor Heater\"  from Ultra Jump connect with the original Jyuki Ningen Jumbor storyline.

His latest attempt in love is at the new transfer student, but a strange otherworldly force seems to be repelling him from her.\n\n3. Williams (2007, Weekly Shonen Jump)  \nWilliam is a young boy who idolizes Aradoff, a character from a popular novel which told Aradoff's adventures, and always dreams of having a grand adventure on his own. William's meeting with the novel author finally puts him on an adventure to prove that the novel is not merely a fiction. \n\n4. Personant (2008, Jump SQ)  \nIn the year 3333, everyone wears personants, technologically advanced masks, to maintain equality and peace, because they eliminate the \"differences\" in people that lead to discrimination and conflict. It has been 100 years since the government implemented this \"personant system,\" so society has adapted. Yet one man exists as the only one in the world without a personant: the wanted criminal Damore! \n\n5. Apple (2009, Weekly Shounen Jump)  \nThe main character (the blond ponytailed guy - yeah, guy) is Aramiya Satoshi, whose main ability is shape-shifting into any animal... though at some point he has plants growing out of him, so he is able shape-shift into any living thing. I'm not sure if he was naturally born that way or if he was a biological experiment. Anyway, he's a pretty easy-going guy who just wants to be left alone to enjoy his solitary life in the middle of a junkyard, but apparently some army or another is always after him because of his ability. Luckily, he is able to fight off entire tank battalions before breakfast. \n\n6. Nisekoi (pilot chapter - 2011, Jump Next!)",

Personant (2008, Jump SQ)  \nIn the year 3333, everyone wears personants, technologically advanced masks, to maintain equality and peace, because they eliminate the \"differences\" in people that lead to discrimination and conflict. It has been 100 years since the government implemented this \"personant system,\" so society has adapted. Yet one man exists as the only one in the world without a personant: the wanted criminal Damore! \n\n5. Apple (2009, Weekly Shounen Jump)  \nThe main character (the blond ponytailed guy - yeah, guy) is Aramiya Satoshi, whose main ability is shape-shifting into any animal... though at some point he has plants growing out of him, so he is able shape-shift into any living thing. I'm not sure if he was naturally born that way or if he was a biological experiment. Anyway, he's a pretty easy-going guy who just wants to be left alone to enjoy his solitary life in the middle of a junkyard, but apparently some army or another is always after him because of his ability. Luckily, he is able to fight off entire tank battalions before breakfast. \n\n6. Nisekoi (pilot chapter - 2011, Jump Next!)",

    "mu_description": "From VIZ:  \nWinning isn't everything in the game of basketball, but who wants to come in second? It takes dedication and discipline to be the best, and the Shohoku High hoops team wants to be just that. They have one last year to make their captain's dream of reaching the finals come true--will they do it? Takehiko Inoue's legendary beloved basketball manga is finally here and the tale of a lifetime is in your hands.  \nHanamichi Sakuragi's got no game with girls—none at all! It doesn't help that he's known for throwing down at a moment's notice and always coming out on top. A hopeless bruiser, he's been rejected by 50 girls in a row! All that changes when he meets the girl of his dreams, Haruko, and she's actually not afraid of him! When she introduces him to the game of basketball, his life is changed forever.\n\nTo commemorate the 100 Million sales of the series, a one-shot called “10 Days After” was drawn by the author in a classroom at Kanagawa Prefectural Misaki High School in December 2004. This epilogue later published in a special documentary book and Switch magazine in 2005.\n\nNotes: Received the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen in 1995.",

Some might even say he's cocky, but at least he's got the skills to back up his attitude. With his virtually unreturnable \"twist serve,\" Ryoma is sure to make the starting team.   \nJoin Ryoma and the other first years, as they train hard, make friends, and try to find a place for themselves on the team.

However, there is one universally acknowledged rule—don't cross first year student Tatsumi Oga, Ishiyama's most vicious fighter.  \nOne day, Oga is by a riverbed when he encounters a man floating down the river. After being retrieved by Oga, the man splits down the middle to reveal a baby, which crawls onto Oga's back and immediately forms an attachment to him. Though he doesn't know it yet, this baby is named Kaiser de Emperana Beelzebub IV, or \"Baby Beel\" for short—the son of the Demon Lord!  \nAs if finding the future Lord of the Underworld isn't enough, Oga is also confronted by Hildegard, Beel's demon maid who insists he take responsibility as Beel's guardian. Together they attempt to raise Baby Beel—although surrounded by juvenile delinquents and demonic powers, the two of them may be in for more of a challenge than they can imagine.",

If somebody wants to know how to drive a car, they just download the driving App into a special label that gets placed on their body. But in this Ability Society, there is a poor teenager named Heita who is unable to synchronize with the labels and therefore has no place in society.\n\nOne day, Heita finds himself involved with the smuggling of a special label that just happens to synchronize with him and him alone. Suddenly, a man in a black suit named Kandera arrests Heita for the possession of an illegal label. When Kandera notices that the label has synchronized with Heita, he makes a deal with him. If Heita works with Kandera in the special police task force finding more special labels, Heita's crime will be forgiven. Now Heita has to work together with the strange people working in the special police task force and try to remove illegal labels from the streets.",

So he invites her to the roof to talk about something. Thinking he is about to confess his love she gets excited at first, until he tells her that he hates her because she is such a busy-body and a goody-two-shoes. That would be the end of it, if not for a small detail: Samon can actually summon Demons and decides to get her to show her true colors by saddling her with Demons to tempt her into acting slothful or gluttonous for example. Watching greedy people getting corrupted by demons is a favorite past-time of his after all. As the Demon world is pissed at Samon because  he summons Demons so often, Assassins are sent after him and his perceived associates.   \nHe defends Teshigawara from one such attack, because he wants to witness her downfall and a violent death is too boring.",

And since he has found out, he will have to \"collaborate\" − i.e. be the human sacrifice to that end. Nevertheless, just before the \"ritual,\" Taiga decides to confess his love to Anna and is struck by a lightning bolt the second after.

To that end, third-year high school student Nariyuki Yuiga dedicated himself to becoming ranked as a high-achieving student, despite his history of poor grades. In order to give his destitute family a better life, his ultimate goal was to obtain the special VIP nomination, a prestigious scholarship covering all future university tuition fees. Although Nariyuki could feasibly be a shoe-in for the nomination, he is constantly overshadowed by classmates Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi in mathematics and literature, respectively.\n\nTo his delight, Nariyuki receives the nomination, but there's a catch: he has to tutor his two star classmates, who are each hopelessly mediocre at the other’s subject of expertise! To make matters worse, the subjects they are horrible at are the same subjects they want to pursue for their future. As the time to submit university applications draws nearer, Nariyuki must find an effective tutoring method for the girls before it’s too late.\n\n[Read for FREE on Manga Plus](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100035)",

    "mu_description": "From part of the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_Commando_Gaiden:_Sugoi_yo!!_Masaru-san): \n\nThe story revolves around Wakame High School's extracurricular club, \"Sexy Commando Club,\" which consists of 5-6 male members (one being the high school principal himself), a female manager, and a small mysterious pet (that may be extraterrestrial in origin). \n\nThe strange and ancient art of Sexy Commando (the roots of which extend back into Japan's Muromachi period) is a martial one; however, instead of focusing on how to defeat an opponent with punches, kicks, or grappling, it focuses on how to distract the opponent. The logic follows that any distracted opponent is unable to fight, and therefore the art of Sexy Commando trumps any other form of martial arts. \n\nThere are as many techniques as there are ways to distract, though Wakame High School's Sexy Command Club tends to favor the unzipping of the trousers (Elize no Yuutsu).",

She meets a demon that tells her to give up her \"work,\" to keep the harmony between the human and supernatural worlds.\n\nVolume 24 contains 13 (サーティーン)\n\nVolume 38 contains Bankara (ばんから)  \nThe cyber revolution seems to be a new weapon that school delinquents take advantage of and cause damage.

To that end, third-year high school student Nariyuki Yuiga dedicated himself to becoming ranked as a high-achieving student, despite his history of poor grades. In order to give his destitute family a better life, his ultimate goal was to obtain the special VIP nomination, a prestigious scholarship covering all future university tuition fees. Although Nariyuki could feasibly be a shoe-in for the nomination, he is constantly overshadowed by classmates Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi in mathematics and literature, respectively.\n\nTo his delight, Nariyuki receives the nomination, but there's a catch: he has to tutor his two star classmates, who are each hopelessly mediocre at the other’s subject of expertise! To make matters worse, the subjects they are horrible at are the same subjects they want to pursue for their future. As the time to submit university applications draws nearer, Nariyuki must find an effective tutoring method for the girls before it’s too late.\n\n[Read for FREE on Manga Plus](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100035)",
