## 🚀 About the Project 
 
**JumpBack** is a fun web app that lets you input your birthdate and instantly find out which issue of *Weekly Shonen Jump* was on newsstands at that time. It shows the magazine cover, issue number, and a list of the manga featured inside! 
 
Whether you're a manga fan or just curious, it's a nostalgic way to connect with your manga history and discover what stories were being published when you entered the world. 📖 
 
## 🛠️ How It Works 
 
1. Select your birthdate using the date picker
2. The app finds the closest *Shonen Jump* issue that was already published on or before that date
3. See the magazine cover and manga titles featured in that issue!
 
The data is sourced from a comprehensive JSON file based on Comic Vine's API.
