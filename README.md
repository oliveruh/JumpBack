## 🚀 About the Project

**JumpBack** is a fun web app that lets you input your birthdate and instantly find out which issue of *Weekly Shonen Jump* was on newsstands at that time.  
It shows the magazine cover, issue number, and a list of the manga featured inside!

Whether you're a manga fan or just curious, it's a nostalgic way to connect with manga history. 📖

## 🛠️ How It Works
