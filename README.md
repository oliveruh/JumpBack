## About the Project 
 
**JumpBack** is a nostalgic web app that reveals which issue of *Weekly Shonen Jump* was released on (or right before) your birthday. Just enter your birthdate, and voilà — you’ll get the actual magazine cover, issue number, and the list of manga that were running at the time.

Whether you’re a lifelong fan or just manga-curious, it’s a fun, personal way to connect with manga history. 🎌
 
## How It Works 
 
1. 📅 Select your birthdate using the calendar
2. 🔍 The app finds the closest *Shonen Jump* issue published *on or before* that date
3. 🖼️ You get the cover, issue number, and featured manga list

> All issue data is sourced from a curated JSON dataset built using the Comic Vine API.
